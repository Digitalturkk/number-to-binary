# number-to-binary

It's just a program that convert your number to binary, hexadecimal and octal code.
In first directory, there is a CLI version of my code.

On another directory, there is a GUI version with python PyQt5 (I'm working on it),
also you can choose from which number system to which number system you want to convert your number.

Fell free to copy and edit my code! But remember, there is a BSD-2 License!
